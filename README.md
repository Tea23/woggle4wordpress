# woggle4wordpress
Fork of Woggle 4 Wordpress theme by hawesWeb productions, supplied here for compliance with the GPL and in the hopes some additions may be useful.

THe original theme is licensed under the GNU GPL but no version is specified. This fork is provided under the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.

## Changes
Because this repo was initialised after changes had been made, a rudimentary diff file has been supplied of `style.css`.

`main.php` contains a new (ugly) script to replace page headers (`the_title()`) with arbitrary content (for example an image).

`index.php` contains an even uglier script to generate a carousel of background images. This is currently not in use on the main website.

## Ugliness
Because I'm not a programmer or a web developer, some of this stuff is really ugly and bad. Pull requests welcome.

## Exclusions
Excluded from this repository are the files for The Serif font due to their licensing.
